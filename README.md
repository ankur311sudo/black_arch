# Black_Arch - Omarchy Theme

An Omarchy Theme for your Arch Linux / Hyprland setup

A dead simple theme for the digital minimalist. Black & white with space to breath. While also going edge-to-edge on your monitor and not wasting valuable screen real estate.

10+ extremely subtle backgrounds. No dramatic backgrounds. No clown-color text. No workspace animations. No nonsense.Jus you and your code 

Einstein & Jobs wore the same thing every day. Now you can too.
